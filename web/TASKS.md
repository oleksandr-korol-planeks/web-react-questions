## Practical Task: Building a Dynamic To-Do List

### Objective

Create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This task will test your ability to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and apply styles dynamically.

### Requirements

1. **HTML**:

   - Create a basic HTML structure with a header, an input field for new tasks, and a button to add tasks.
   - Include an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the tasks.

2. **CSS**:

   - Style the to-do list to make it visually appealing.
   - Use CSS to highlight completed tasks (e.g., strikethrough text).

3. **JavaScript/jQuery**:
   - Write JavaScript/jQuery code to add new tasks to the list when the button is clicked.
   - Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed when they are clicked.
   - Add a button to each task to remove it from the list.

### Bonus

- Add a feature to edit existing tasks.
- Use local storage to save the tasks so that they persist after the page is refreshed.

### Deliverables

- A single HTML file containing the complete code.
- Ensure the code is well-commented and follows best practices.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>To-Do List</title>
    <style>
      /* Add your CSS here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>To-Do List</h1>
    <input type="text" id="new-task" placeholder="Add a new task" />
    <button id="add-task">Add Task</button>
    <ul id="task-list"></ul>

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      // Add your JavaScript/jQuery here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
