# Task

Add the checkboxes to the first column. Write the JavaScript code (vanilla or jQuery-based) that monitors the checkboxes and updates the text inside the element with id="items-info" as Selected XX items. Also, add the click event listener to the "Do action" button, which opens an alert box with the list of selected items.
