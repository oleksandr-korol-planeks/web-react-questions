# Task

Implements the modal window from scratch.

## Additional Requirements

1. The modal should have a smooth fade-in and fade-out animation.
2. The modal should be draggable within the viewport.
3. Clicking outside the modal should also close it.

### Hints

- Use CSS transitions for the animations.
